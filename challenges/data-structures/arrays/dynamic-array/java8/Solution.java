	/*
	Problem:
	You must keep track of an int, here called lastAnswer, and a list of empty sequences.
	You get 2 numbers to begin with:
	- A number of sequences (n) to keep track of
	- A number of commands that follow.
	Then is a list of commands of format: c x y
	If c is 1, then:
	- Find sequence # (x xor lastanswer) % n,
	- Append y to that sequence.
	If c is 2, then:
	- Find sequence # (x xor lastanswer) % n,
	- Find element # y (modulo with size of sequence to wrap)
	- Write that element to lastAnswer, and then print it.
